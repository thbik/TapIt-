TapIt!  gives you the best way to test your reflexes and vigilance!

As the game begins, one of the nine gray tiles becomes orange for a short period of time. 

By the time this tile stays orange player must press it as many times as possible. 
However, if the tile turns gray again and the player presses it, he/she loses one life. 
The player must adapt himself/herself on the fast changes of the tiles' color. 
In case the player remains inactive for a number of turns, he/she also loses one life." 

Be careful! As your score becomes higher, the time in which a tile stays orange is decreased!  

The game is over when the player runs out of lives.
